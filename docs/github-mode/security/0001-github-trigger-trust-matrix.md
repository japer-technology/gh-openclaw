# GitHub Trigger Trust Matrix and Threat Model

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-16
- Owners: GitHub mode maintainers, security maintainers
- Task mapping: Phase 0 Task 0.3 in `docs/github-mode/planning/implementation-tasks.md`

## Purpose

Define trusted and untrusted trigger boundaries, enumerate abuse cases, and map required controls for planned GitHub mode workflows.

## Security invariants (must hold)

1. No privileged workflow execution occurs in untrusted contexts.
2. Privileged branch mutation is allowed only through pull request flow.
3. Secrets are never exposed to fork pull request execution.
4. All privilege elevation requires explicit environment approval gates.

## Trigger trust matrix

| Trigger                             | Context trust level          | Typical actor                          | Secrets allowed                 | Privileged actions allowed               | Required branch mutation path                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `pull_request` from fork            | Untrusted                    | External contributor                   | No                              | No                                       | Pull request only                              |
| `pull_request` from internal branch | Semi-trusted                 | Maintainer/contributor with repo write | Limited, environment-gated only | Only after explicit gate and policy pass | Pull request only                              |
| `push` to protected branches        | Trusted (policy constrained) | Maintainer automation                  | Yes (minimum needed)            | Yes, only if all required checks pass    | Pull request merged into protected branch      |
| `schedule`                          | Trusted automation           | Repository scheduler                   | Yes (minimum needed)            | Yes, read/write only for scoped tasks    | Never direct to protected branch without PR    |
| `workflow_dispatch`                 | Trusted with operator intent | Maintainer/operator                    | Yes (environment scoped)        | Yes, only in approved environments       | Pull request flow for protected branch changes |

### Planned workflow coverage

The matrix applies to planned Phase 3 workflows:

- `github-mode-build`
- `github-mode-check`
- `github-mode-test`
- `github-mode-policy`
- `github-mode-route-sim`
- `github-mode-eval-tier0`
- `github-mode-cost`
- `github-mode-sync-templates`

## Control baseline by trigger

### Fork `pull_request` (untrusted)

- Workflow jobs must run in untrusted-safe mode.
- Token permissions are read-only unless a documented exception exists.
- No environment or repository secrets may be exposed.
- Privileged jobs (deploy, promotion, branch mutation, secret access) must be hard-skipped.

### Internal `pull_request` (semi-trusted)

- All security-sensitive workflow changes require CODEOWNERS approval.
- Privileged jobs must be gated behind explicit policy checks plus environment approval.
- Branch mutation is disallowed from PR jobs; output is proposal artifacts or PR comments only.

### `push`, `schedule`, `workflow_dispatch` (trusted)

- Must still use least-privilege token scopes.
- Protected branch mutation must originate from reviewed PR merges.
- Privileged jobs require environment protections and auditable approvals.

## Conformance checks required for Phase 0 completion

1. Trigger matrix exists and covers: fork PR, internal PR, push, schedule, manual dispatch.
2. Every abuse case has at least one preventive and one detective control.
3. Security invariants are encoded in docs and referenced by implementation tasks.
4. Maintainers approve this document in PR review.

## Maintainer review checklist

- [ ] Trigger trust levels are accurate for repository policy.
- [ ] Matrix covers all planned workflow triggers.
- [ ] Abuse cases are realistic and mapped to enforceable controls.
- [ ] Guardrails prohibit privileged execution in untrusted contexts.
- [ ] Guardrails restrict privileged branch mutation to PR flow.
