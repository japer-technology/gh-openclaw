> **Status:** Active development. APIs, contracts, and workflows may evolve quickly.

GitHub Mode makes GitHub the runtime control plane for **OpenClaw** collaboration.

If standard OpenClaw is optimized for fast local iteration, GitHub Mode is optimized for **team-scale governance**:

- behavior defined by committed and reviewed repository state,
- auditable execution via pull requests and Actions logs,
- contract validation as part of CI,
- policy-first operation with explicit security boundaries.

This repository should be treated as the **GitHub Mode component first**: docs, contracts, and workflows here are the primary product surface for GitHub Mode operators.

---

## What GitHub Mode is (and is not)

### GitHub Mode **is**

- A repository-native orchestration layer for OpenClaw.
- A contract-driven system anchored in `runtime/github-mode/`.
- A policy and workflow stack enforced in `.github/` and `scripts/github-mode/`.

### GitHub Mode **is not**

- A replacement for the installed/local OpenClaw runtime.
- A reason to tightly couple GitHub automation internals to `src/**` implementation details.
- An excuse to bypass review for high-trust workflow or policy changes.

---

## Repository areas that define GitHub Mode

- `docs/github-mode/` — architecture, security model, planning, and rationale.
- `runtime/github-mode/` — machine-readable contracts and schemas.
- `.github/workflows/github-mode-*` — mode-specific CI, policy, and automation gates.
- `scripts/github-mode/` — validation and upstream-safe guardrail tooling.
- `test/github-mode/` — targeted contract and policy behavior tests.

When contributing, prefer changes inside these paths unless there is a clear architectural reason not to.

---

## Architecture boundaries

GitHub Mode is intentionally additive and boundary-aware:

- Installed runtime internals remain owned by `src/**`.
- GitHub Mode execution and governance remain owned by repository paths listed above.
- Runtime behavior should align with extension architecture (`extensions/github/`) rather than ad-hoc coupling into core runtime internals.

Authoritative architecture decisions:

- ADR 0001: Runtime Boundary and Ownership  
  https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/docs/github-mode/adr/0001-runtime-boundary-and-ownership.md
- ADR 0002: Installed Runtime Non-Regression Guardrails  
  https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/docs/github-mode/adr/0002-installed-runtime-non-regression-guardrails.md

---

## Security posture

GitHub Mode assumes trigger, event, and input surfaces are untrusted until proven otherwise.

- Trust matrix:  
  https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/docs/github-mode/security/0001-github-trigger-trust-matrix.md
- Skills quarantine pipeline:  
  https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/docs/github-mode/security/0002-skills-quarantine-pipeline.md

Minimum expectations:

- validate and constrain workflow inputs,
- keep secret exposure minimal and explicit,
- require review on workflow/policy changes that alter privilege or execution boundaries.

## Quick start for contributors

### 1) Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm
- GitHub repository access with Actions permissions

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2) Validate runtime contracts

```bash
pnpm contracts:github:validate
```

### 3) Run GitHub Mode guardrails

```bash
node --import tsx scripts/github-mode/check-upstream-additions-only.ts
pnpm test -- test/github-mode/validate-github-runtime-contracts.test.ts test/github-mode/check-upstream-additions-only.test.ts
```

### 4) Run full project quality checks before PR

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm check
pnpm test
```

## Contribution workflow for GitHub Mode changes

1. **Define intent clearly** — contract, workflow, docs, security policy, or test coverage.
2. **Keep changes additive** — avoid broad edits outside mode-owned directories.
3. **Update docs with behavior** — architecture and policy docs must stay in sync.
4. **Prove safety locally** — contract validation + targeted tests before full suite.
5. **Open focused PRs** — include rationale, risk impact, and rollback strategy.
